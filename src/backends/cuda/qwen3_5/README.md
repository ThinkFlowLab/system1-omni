# Qwen3.5/3.8 prefill operations

CUDA kernels for a prefill-only Qwen3.5/3.8 forward pass, built into `libqwen3_5_cuda.so` with a C interface ([`ops.h`](ops.h)), so that a Rust model engine loads it at run time and builds without a CUDA toolkit. The Cua-S1 and Open-Jev native workers share the layer loop and buffers in [`src/models/qwen3_5/native/`](../../../models/qwen3_5/native/).

```sh
src/backends/cuda/qwen3_5/build.sh <output dir> [compute capability, default 89]
```

The norm, elementwise and q/k preparation kernels round to bfloat16 where Transformers (`modeling_qwen3_5.py`) does. Attention (FlashAttention-2 style, on tensor cores) and the chunked gated delta rule keep some intermediate results in bfloat16, as FlashAttention and flash-linear-attention do. GEMMs go through cuBLASLt with its first heuristic choice. Tensor-core kernels need sm_80 or newer; PR #19 validated the original kernels on sm_89. The current reference tests, including fused gating, cached residual RMSNorm and packed SiLU, passed on H200 (sm_90).

`cs1_attention_gated` fuses the sigmoid gate into the attention epilogue, preserving
the BF16 rounding of both attention and sigmoid before multiplication. The native
workers use this entry point; the separate operations remain available for kernel
comparisons. Rebuild the library and workers together for ABI version 4, which
includes the CUDA Graph entry points and gated attention.
