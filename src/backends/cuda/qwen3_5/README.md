# Qwen3.5 prefill operations

CUDA kernels for a prefill-only Qwen3.5 forward pass, built into `libqwen3_5_cuda.so` with a C interface ([`ops.h`](ops.h)), so that a Rust model engine loads it at run time and builds without a CUDA toolkit. The Cua-S1 native worker ([`src/models/cua_s1/native/`](../../../models/cua_s1/native/)) uses it and keeps the layer loop and buffers.

```sh
src/backends/cuda/qwen3_5/build.sh <output dir> [compute capability, default 89]
```

The norm, elementwise and q/k preparation kernels round to bfloat16 where Transformers (`modeling_qwen3_5.py`) does. Attention (FlashAttention-2 style, on tensor cores) and the chunked gated delta rule keep some intermediate results in bfloat16, as FlashAttention and flash-linear-attention do. GEMMs go through cuBLASLt with its first heuristic choice. Tensor-core kernels need sm_80 or newer. The native worker was previously run on sm_89; the current kernel tests and GDN measurements cover sm_90. Compilation passed for sm_80, sm_89 and sm_90; execution of the modified GDN kernel on sm_80/sm_89 remains unverified.

Gated DeltaNet preparation stores converted TF32 operands in three-byte component planes, preserves the original four-term TF32 accumulation, and writes U/W fragments directly as bfloat16. Dynamic shared memory is 72 KiB per block. The [H200 comparison](../../../../benchmarks/gdn/README.md) records complete GDN call latency, numerical checks, and the small end-to-end change measured with the Open-Jev worker from PR #55.
